			<h2>Zombiegame <span>v0.0.1</span></h2>
			<p>
				So, you've been sent here to try the Zomebiegame, congratulations! It's actually very, very simple. You're a
				soldier who's been deployed to find out what the hell is going on in the area, along with your fellow soldiers.
				Your mission is to find out what the hell is going on - and take down a few zombies while doing it!
			</p>
			<h3>Controls</h3>
			<div class="controls">
				<p>
					The movement is fairly straightforward. You move forward on W, and backwards on S. You control the direction
					with the mouse, and you shoot on the left mousebutton. <br /><br />
					The numbers 1 - 5 is the guns you pick up along the way, and 6 and 7 lets you take an antidote or a use a
					medkit. CTRL makes you throw a granade, if you got any.<br /><br />
					Oh, and you reload on R. Very crucial to remember that one!

			<h3>UI</h3>

					In the top left corner, you can see your current mission and what you're supposed to do with it. In the left
					side of the screen, you can see the different special items and if you have obtained them, and if you're
					useable or on cooldown.<br /><br />
					By default you only have the mission tracker (used on M), and the flashlight (used on F) In the lower right
					corner, is your backpack and your craft menu. You pick up stuff along the way, from monsters and boxes, and
					you can craft stuff to help you on your way!

					Allright, that should be all you need to know. Give it a whirl, and hopefully you'll be able to tell me what
					happens when you finish the game! Game on hombre!
