			<h2>Zomebiegame (v 0.0.1)</h2>
			<p>So, you've been sent here to try the Zomebiegame, congratulations!</p>
			<div>
				<p>
					It's actually very, very simple. You're a soldier who's been deployed to find out what the hell is going on in
					the area, along with your fellow soldiers
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Controls</h3>
				<p>
					The movement is fairly straightforward. You move forward on W, and backwards on S. You control the direction
					with the mouse, and you shoot on the left mousebutton
				</p>
				<p>
					The numbers 1 - 5 is the guns you pick up along the way, and 6 and 7 lets you take an antidote or a use a
					medkit. CTRL makes you throw a granade, if you got any.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>UI</h3>
				<p>In the top left corner, you can see your current mission and what you're supposed to do with it.</p>
				<p>
					In the left side of the screen, you can see the different special items and if you have obtained them, and if
					you're useable or on cooldown. By default you only have the mission tracker (used on M), and the flashlight
					(turned on an off on F)
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>
					In the lower right corner, is your backpack and your craft menu. You pick up stuff along the way, from
					monsters and boxes, and you can craft stuff to help you on your way.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>Allright, that should be all you need to know. Game on hombre!</p>
